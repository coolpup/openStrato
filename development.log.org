  Starting to look at the sources again.
  I guess the problem was getting -anything- on the screen.

  Removed some syntactic mistakes first now.

  loading pictures into textures almost works - but not when run through a file server:
  -> Use simple python web server instead: 

     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
               then http://localhost:8000 has the current dir.

  Found the glMatrix library by Brandon Jones - seems to be a nice one.
